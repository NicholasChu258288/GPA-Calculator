# GPA-Calculator
A GPA Calculator I developed to learn app design and practice using buttons, multiple screens and designing a user interface that would take in user-generated data and return an appropriate screen. 
To run go into the GPA Calculator folder and then open the file titled 'index'. When inputting grades please only use the letter grade and do add - or + in front of then for the app to work.
